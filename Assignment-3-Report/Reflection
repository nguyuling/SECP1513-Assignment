Through this Industrial Talk 2.0 sharing session, I was able to take a glance on the actual working life of the technology industry including the various job scopes, and the interaction between them. As a computer science student and future graduate, this allows me to make a plan ahead about my future job as well as challenges. I am also being aware of the ever changing technology industry and the skills and right attitude I should be equipped with before stepping foot in the industry.
